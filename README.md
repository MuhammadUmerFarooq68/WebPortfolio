><p>Welcome to mytechtrail, a webfolio designed to showcase the trails I've blazed in the ever-evolving landscape of tech.<p>

### Modern UI Scheme

The website is built with a contemporary and aesthetically pleasing user interface. The design focuses on simplicity, clarity, and usability, ensuring a seamless experience for users. The theme is responsive and adapts beautifully across various devices and screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

### Animation with GSAP

To enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the website, I use GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). GSAP is a powerful JavaScript library that allows us to create high-performance animations.

### Real-time Data with Web Scraping

In the blog section of the website, I employ web scraping techniques to fetch real-time data from various sources. This ensures that the content is always up-to-date and relevant.

### Contact Page with EmailJS

The contact page is powered by EmailJS, a service that allows us to send emails directly from the website without requiring a backend server.
